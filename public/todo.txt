- Add TAGS const in each file, for better logging
- chaincode module, routes.js shouldnt directly call any chaincode functions, should do so from an interface
- make add-product route secure
- CHANGE IBM BLOCKCHAIN JS TO HFC SDK!!! hopefully that throws errors and isnt a pain to deploy like it is now
- limit amount of products that can be purchased (limit field in db or Blockchain?)
